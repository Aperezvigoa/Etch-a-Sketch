# Etch-a-Sketch Project (The Odin Project: Foundations)

A browser-based Etch-a-Sketch-style sketchpad built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—part of the Foundations course at The Odin Project.

## Description

This project is designed to strengthen DOM manipulation skills by creating a dynamic drawing grid where users can paint grid cells with random pastel colors on hover. The sketchpad is interactive, adjustable, and entirely generated and handled via JavaScript—making it a powerful exercise in understanding event-driven programming and layout control.
